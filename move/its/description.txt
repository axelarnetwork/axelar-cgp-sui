For Sui Native assets:

- anyone can deploy a new native asset specifying decimals, name, symbol, a tokenId is created from these params
- then they're free to send this token (linked by type) to as some tokenId
- event is emitted, coin is stored in the bridge as native

Storage structure:
```
    ITS ==( Key<Type> { tokenId } )==> Balance<Type>
```
